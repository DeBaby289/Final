<h1>Animal Rescue</h1>
<p style="font-size:150%">Animal  rescue is a game raising awareness to people about all the harsh things being done to animals. 

In this game we have two main characters named Chipotle and Squirt. Chipotle and Squirt are on two different levels and each level is telling a different story. 

In Chipotles story it's letting people know how many cats/kittens are being abused in their homes and how their being treated differently and not being cared for.

Squirts story is letting people know how elephants around the world are being beaten in circuses in Africa and Asia and squirt is also trying to help elephants who are being hunted by local poachers in Africa.
